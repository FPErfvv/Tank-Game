# Tank-Game
This respository contains the code for Tank Game. The task of the player is to save the world from climate change. Because the cattle industry is a substantial contributor of greenhouse gas emissions, the player will be tasked with killing all the cows on the map. To make it more challenging, the cows will be equiped with various weaponry. Over time, the weapons will become more advanced and the cows will become more difficult to kill.

The game is still very much in development. Tank Game is created using the Java Swing graphics library instead of a prebuilt game engine. The basic game mechanics (collisions, basic physics, procedural terrain generation, etc) are being created before higher level game elements can be implemented. Seen below is a snapshot of the game at this point.
