# Tank-Game
This respository contains the code for Tank Game. The task of the player is to save the world from climate change. Because the cattle industry is a substantial contributor of greenhouse gas emmissions, the player will be tasked with killing all the cows on the map. To make it more challenging, the cows will be equiped with various weaponry. Over time, the weapons will become more advanced and the cows will become more difficult to kill.
